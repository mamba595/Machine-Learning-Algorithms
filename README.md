# Machine Learning Algorithms

## Description
In this repository I implement Machine Learning algorithms in Kaggle competitions, preparing the data beforehand through preprocessing, cleaning and feature engineering using Pandas library.

Some algorithms were developed from scratch using Pytorch for gradient descent, and for others I used Scikit-learn models for efficiency. All the algorithms were tested in competitions, obtaining good results.

I've also worked with the Numpy library to prepare the tensors for the Pytorch deep neural networks.
